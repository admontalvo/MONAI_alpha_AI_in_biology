### Image Segmentation of a human Spleen using MONAI alpha_AI_in_biology

The idea of this repository was derived from the ISIC 2018: Skin Lesion Analysis Towards Melanoma Detection Challenge. The goal of this challenge was to to help participants develop image analysis tools to enable the automated diagnosis of melanoma from dermoscopic images. Participants were tasked with three tasks listed below. In this repository image segmentation was performed on a spleen utalizing the images from this challenge.

#Task 1: Lesion Segmentation
#Task 2: Lesion Attribute Detection
#Task 3: Disease Classification

### MONAI and image segmentation
In this repositry project we used Medical Open Network for AI (MONAI) to segment the spleen from medical images using the the Project-MONAI 3d segmentation tutorials as a framework (https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/main/3d_segmentation/spleen_segmentation_3d.ipynb) and to test the power of MONAI with segmentation and medical images.
